The results of the model show that size of the brain 
can best be explained with information about Height and Sex, 
as well as also some influence from the Performance Intelligence Quotient.
For the most part this aligns with theory, as height is a common characteristic
considered to have a relationship with brain size. The most interesting result of the model is 
 the significance of the Performance Intelligence Quotient. Full Scale Intelligence and 
 Verbal Intelligence were found to not have a significant effect on the model, however interaction
 terms for PIQ: Height and PIQ: Sex seem to be relevant to the model, and further research into this
 specific type of intelligence could be interesting. The relationship between the physical aspects of 
 the brain and factors influenceing it is certainly a research question that can be analyzed from many different sides.
