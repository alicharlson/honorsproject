The field of neuroscience is extremely interested in how the developments of the brain are related to other aspects of life. Relationships between the brain - the physical characteristics of the organ, and the mind - the philisophical and emotional characteristics of a person, are especially of interest, as both the brain and the mind are essentially the same entity but serve very different, although interrelated, functions. This regression model hopes to find a way to best explain the relationship between the physical size of the brain and five other possible explanatory predictors: Full Scale Intelligence, Verbal Intelligence, Performance Intelligence, Weight, Height, and Sex.
Brain size was measured using MRI scans and calculated by the number of non-zero gray scale pixels in an image, which indicate areas of gray matter. It is labeled as "MRI_Count."
