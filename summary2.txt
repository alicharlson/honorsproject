The model has an intercept of 8.79 with five predictors. The included variables are Height, Sex, PIQ, and interaction terms PIQ: Height and PIQ: Sex. The most important predictors in the model are Height and Sex, which are displayed in the plot below. Assuming all other variables are constant, a one inch increase in Height results in an average increase in MRI Count by .25. The Sex predictor explains the average differencees between Males and Females, showing an average increase in MRI Count for Males when compared to Females. The final model had an R-squared of .67 and an adjusted R-squared of .62, which is a pretty good fit for a multiple regression model.
